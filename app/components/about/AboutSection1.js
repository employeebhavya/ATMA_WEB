                The American Tamil Medical Association (ATMA) is a nonprofit
                organization founded to unite Tamil healthcare professionals
                across the United States. With over 800 members, ATMA serves as
                a platform for medical professionals to collaborate, share
                knowledge, and contribute to global healthcare improvements. Our
                mission is to provide accessible healthcare to underserved
                communities through medical camps, health awareness programs,
                and charitable outreach. We are committed to advancing medical
                education and supporting Tamil communities globally. Through
                annual conventions, professional networking, and humanitarian
                initiatives, ATMA fosters a strong sense of unity and purpose
                among Tamil medical professionals. Our charitable arm, ATMA-CF,
                extends our impact by funding scholarships, medical supplies,
                and disaster relief efforts, ensuring that healthcare reaches
                those who need it most. At ATMA, we believe in combining
                professional excellence with social responsibility to create a
                lasting impact in the field of healthcare.
